    "I can't do without it. I wake up in the morning and my eyes are blood shot... I need it, I can't function without it. Give me that sweet bean juice!!! I recently decided that I am moving to vancouver because 1. It is the most beautiful city I have been to and 2. It is the most beautiful city that I have been to. However, when I move there, there is one simple must that I cannot do without. BEAN JUICE. I need it.... I have headaches without it. I like it with steamed milk. I like a good single origin gesha pour over. GIVE ME THAT BEAN JUICE!!! I am looking for the perfect neighborhood in Vancouver where I can rely on a short walk to get my coffee every morning. So I am doing this exercise to find the neighborhood cluster that has the best access to coffee possible. Additionally, I love bread, sweets, and good food of the Japanese variety. I am hoping to find a neighborhood that first and foremost gives me access to an ample supply of my BEAN JUICE and good japanese food or desserts."
